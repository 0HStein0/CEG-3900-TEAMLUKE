## Cypher/crypto
- Cyberchef local install?
    - Going to Cyberchefs website and clicking the top left corner, but the website does not require local installation, but the option is given.
    - While all the features are given on the website, some may prefer to install a standalone copy of Cyberchef, which is now yours, and you can run it where the network may be segmented, or there is little to no internet connection. 
- Cyberchef notes
    - Cyberchef allows you to analyze and decode/encode data
    - Cyberchef has many encryption options, allowing you to encode/decode in many different ways
    - Cyberchef is fully "server-free," meaning that no inputs or outputs are saved or sent anywhere.
- quipquip notes
    - Quipqiup is a web-based tool used to solve substitution ciphers.
    - Quipqiup uses frequency analysis to decode encrypted text.
    - Quipqiup runs in the browser and does not require installation.
- Shift
    - Shift just means that the alphabet is shifted over a certain number. 
    - In this case, the shift is encrypted using ROT-13, ROT means rotated, and 13 means the letters are rotated 13 times, for example: A=N, B=O, C=P.
    - Something to remember is that the shift cipher is always the alphabet, but just shifted down.
