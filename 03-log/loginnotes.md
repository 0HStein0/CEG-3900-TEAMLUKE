# Login Notes

A login is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting access to a system, application, or network. It acts as the first line of defense in cybersecurity by ensuring only authorized users can access protected resources. Login systems are commonly used in websites, operating systems, enterprise networks, banking platforms, and cloud services.

The login process typically involves entering credentials such as a username and password, which are validated against stored authentication data.

## Key Concepts

### Authentication v Authorization

- Authentication - Verifies identity
- Authorization - Determines permissions

### Credentials

Information used to verify identity:
- Username
- Password
- PIN
- Security tokens
- Biometrics (fingerprint, face ID)

### Password Hashing

Passwords are stored as hashes instead of plain text. Hashing algorithms such as SHA-256 protect passwords even as a database is compromised.

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Requires two or more verification methods:

- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something you are

### Session Management

After login, a system creates a session (often using cookies or tokens) so the user stays authenticated while navigating.

### Brute Force Attacks

An attack where many password combinations are tried until the correct one is found.

### Account Lockout

Security feature that locks an account after multiple failed login attempts.

### CAPTCHA

Prevents automated login attempts by verifying the user is human.

### SINGLE SIGN-ON

Allows users to log in once and access multiple systems without re-entering credentials.
